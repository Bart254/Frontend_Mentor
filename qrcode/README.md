## Overview

The challenge is to replicate a QR code leading to frontend mentor website. Only html and css is used in this project, and, for being a simple one, responsive design is not included.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)


### What I learned

- The semantic of html page. I learnt how to use semantic tags: header, main, footer; where and when they are appropriate.
- When to use img element vs background-image
- Importing and using google fonts
- Using css flexbox and its properties.
- General css properties to include in the body: font-size, font-family, line-height

```html
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code leading to Frontend Mentor">
```
```css
* {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

- I plan to continue learning semantic html for better representation of the DOM, enhanced accessibility and readability.

- While learning css flexbox I came across grid representation. I would like to learn more on it since I'm aware it is the best alternative to some scenarios, especially, where nested flexboxes is encountered.

- Best practices in assigning values to css properties when building a responsive website is another goal in my repertoire. Also, when to use img tag and background image

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with quick references for styling properties. I'd recommend it for someone who needs a quick reminder of css properties and html tags. It provides comprehensive details without being verbose.
- [MDN](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - A much detailed reference for html, css and javascript. Helps when you want a deeper dive into styling and page structure. verbose but well-detailed.
