## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

The semantic of html page. I learnt how to use semantic tags: header, main, footer; where and when they are appropriate.
When to use img element vs background-image
Importing and using google fonts
Using css flexbox and its properties.
General css properties to include in the body: font-size, font-family, line-height

```html
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code leading to Frontend Mentor">
```
```css
* {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning semantic html for better representation of the DOM, enhanced accessibility and readability.

While learning css flexbox I came across grid representation. I would like to learn more on it since I'm aware it is the best alternative to some scenarios, especially, where nested flexboxes is encountered.

Best practices in assigning values to css properties when building a responsive website is another goal in my repertoire. Also, when to use img tag and background image
